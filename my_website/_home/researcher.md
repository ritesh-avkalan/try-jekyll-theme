name:  Abhinav Gupta
intro_role: I am a professional CAE engineer with doctorate in computational mechanics.
intro_paragraph: >
  Since 2017, I have worked on developing HPC algorithms for simulation as a part of my doctoral studies. On this website, you will find a culmination of ideas and notes on productivity, presentation, coding, research, simulation, and animation. If you want to discuss high performance computing with finite element method, I would happily chat with you. To schedule an appointment, please book a time on my calendar.

  I have five years of industrial experience analyzing and designing power plants at the "Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited".
  Right now, I’m working at Vanderbilt university, USA, where I work on exploring the applications of finite element methods to solve real-world engineering problems by utilizing the power of HPC.

  I ♥️ to code. I took coding as an elective subject during high school and loved it.
  My first project was a fees management system that I had developed in FoxPro - a relational database management system.
  Since then, I have developed a few [Android applications](https://www.eigenplus.com) and have made a few [websites](https://www.abhigupta.io/pages/projects).
  Through this website I plan to share my knowlege in the field of computational mechanics.

  In today's day and age, producing quality academic research is not just about the researcher and the library.
  You must augment your knowledge and skills with all the resources available to you in the digital landscape to make the most of your time.
  In this Ph.D. essential guide, I have curated all the software, hardware, websites, chrome extensions, and coursework I recommend and use for my academic research.

  My core areas of interest are mathematics, computer programming, and art. I have always tried to find creative and aesthetically pleasing solutions to my problems. I code for fun and have developed for desktop, web, and mobile. Here are some of my projects (or that I have contributed to) that I'm proud of.
