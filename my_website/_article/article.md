 In my doctoral studies, I am working on developing algorithms capable of harnessing the power of high-performance computing. The central question that drives my work is, <strong>"How can we get high-fidelity simulations under a realistic time-to-solution?"</strong> To find an answer to that question, I am researching the topics of parallelization, higher-order finite element simulations, and better programming practices.
